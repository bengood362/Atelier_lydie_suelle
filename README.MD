# Simulator for Atelier Lydie & Suelle
One upon a day I am playing Atelier Lydie & Suelle on my switch, and I had a hard time trying to mix ingredients. Using those ingredients, can I unlock that skill? Well, I don't know, but program can probably brute force it, so I made this simulator. 

Currently the ingredients calculator is still under development. So don't bother use it. I only use github to do versioning.
